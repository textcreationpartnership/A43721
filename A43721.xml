            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ABout the latter end of the eighth moneth in this year accounted 1659. as I was paſſing through <hi>Denbigh-ſhire</hi> into <hi>Shrop-ſhire,</hi> I heard of a great boaſting that was amongſt the Prieſts followers, how that ene <hi>Edward Laurance</hi> had overthrown the <hi>Quakers,</hi> at a diſpute which was at <hi>Milford-hall</hi> in <hi>Shrop-ſhire,</hi> in which County I heard the like boaſting and in ſome other parts, and perceiving that a falſe teſtimony had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to laſt how it was carried on that day; The aforeſaid <hi>Edward</hi> wrote five Poſitions, which he give to one which is called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and promiſed to prove them at ſome of their meetings, upon which the day was appointed; and being ſo, that a pretty diſtance of time was between the delivering of his Paper, and the time he was to prove what he had wrote in it, the noiſe of it ſpread abroad and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <head>The Saints juſtified, and the Accuſers found out.</head>
            <head>Firſt the Prieſt ſaid as followeth.</head>
            <p>Pr. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> 
               <hi>undertook to prove that the deareſt Saints of God living upon earth have ſin, and that I do thus, By proving that the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>cried out of a body of ſin, and that</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>was a man after Gods own heart, and yet a ſinner, and</hi> John <hi>ſaid if we ſay we have no ſin we deceive our ſelves, &amp;c. as</hi> Rom. 7.24. &amp; 1 Joh. 1.8. Eccleſ. 7.20. &amp; 2 Sam. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The end for which this Poſition was laid down and theſe Scriptures brought forth for, was to prove, That no man cannot, but while that he lives here, he muſt live in ſin; This being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed, and theſe Scriptures honeſtly read over, a rational man may ſee they prove no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>When the Devil tempted Chriſt, he for his own ends made uſe of the Scriptures, &amp; tis no marvel if his Miniſters do the like to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Scriptures, like him, to bring if they can about their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deſignes; &amp; though ſuch labour in the Scriptures, by turning over leaf after leaf, and quoting line after line, to prove that none can live here, but whileſt they live here they muſt live in ſin, yet ſuch Labour not in the Word and Doctrine, nor ſpeaks the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as they were ſpake forth by the true Prophets and Apoſtles, but uſeth them to anſwer their ends, (to wit) to accuſe the Saints with, and to prove them to live in ſin, yea the deareſt of them, ſo the Devil hath true ſervice by them, that great Dragon and old Serpent which deceiveth the World and accuſeth the Saints, <hi>Rev,</hi> 12.9, 10. Surely you Prieſts have brows as of braſſe, and the ſinews of your necks are as Iron, and it may as truly be ſaid of you, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid to your forefathers, Were ye aſhamed when ye had done abomination, (nay) <hi>ye were not at all aſhamed, neither could ye bluſh, Jer.</hi> 6.13, 14, 15. yea ye are more unexcuſable then theſe, ſeeing you profeſſe your ſelves to be Miniſters of Chriſt, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er abomination could ſcarce be committed, then to accuſe the Saints, and affirm that none while they live here cannot but they muſt live in ſin, for hereby the power of God and the end for which Chriſt was ſent is denied, yea, and more power attributed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37369:3"/>
to the Devil, over man while he is here then unto God, ſurely the Devil is much beholding to ſuch Miniſters as theſe who are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his work, And I know no reaſon why any ſhould be judged as tranſgreſſors who tell you that you are of your father the Devil and are doing his work.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the accuſers of the Saints, &amp; fellow-heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Satan in this time of the glorious breaking forth of the Goſpel of our God &amp; his Son Chriſt, makes it a great part of their work to accuſe the Saints of the moſt high God, and to inſinuate it into others, That none can but live in ſin here, which Doctrine pleaſeth the fleſhly part in man, which according or agreeing with it, ſound Doctrine by ſuch will not be received, and the Scripture is fulfilled which ſaid, The time ſhould come that found Doctrine would not be received, and <hi>Timothy</hi> ſpeaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly by the Spirit, <hi>That in the latter times ſome ſhould depart from the Faith,</hi> (take notice of that) <hi>giving heed to ſeducing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Doctrines of Devils,</hi> and it is a Doctrine of the Devil to accuſe the Saints, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. and to teach people that none can but live in ſin here, and that though they live in ſin, yet they may ſerve God too, when Chriſt ſaid <hi>No man can ſerve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaid <hi>Be not deceived Brethren, whoſoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in Chriſt ſinneth not,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. to 7. and they who give heed to ſeducing ſpirits and doctrines of Devils are erred from the Faith, and you who ſay that none cannot, but while they live here they muſt live in ſin, and quote Scripture to prove the Aſſertion, I never found that Scripture yet that ſaid ſo, and I have been a ſearcher of them thirty years, and if the Scriptures be not your ground, and yet quoted by you for a ground, then your doctrine is without a bottom, and muſt needs be ſuch as proceeds out of the bottomleſſe pit, which is ſo ſmoaky and black that the Ayre is darkened by it. Now that the wicked do live in ſin, that we do acknowledge, and if the Saints cannot but live in ſin too, where is the difference between them both, in what doth it conſiſt what doth it ſtand in words and out-ſide profeſſions? No) for Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Except your Righteouſneſſe exceed the Righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.20. and they who live in ſin do live after the fleſh, for ſin is a fruit of the fleſh, and as they who live after the fleſh do minde the things of the fleſh, ſo they who live after the Spirit do minde the things of the Spirit, and the Apoſtle ſaid <hi>Walk in the Spirit,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37369:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>And again, whereas it is affirmed that there never was any man that was without ſin here, or that can be, this is an affirmation that the Scripture will not juſtifie, for in the Scriptures are the names of divers recorded as cannot juſtly be charged with any ſin, as <hi>Abel, Enoch, John</hi> Baptiſt, and ſeveral others, and Chriſt the Son of God, who came to deſtroy the works of the devil, for to this end was he made manifeſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.8. <hi>And he ſaid be ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> and man was not created to live in ſin here, but to live in the Spirit, where the fruits of the fleſh is not fulfilled, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. And they who live in ſin follows not Chriſt for their Leader, but him who leads into ſin, who is the prince of the Aire who ruleth in the Children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and therefore muſt the wrath of God be powred upon the Children of diſobedience, who follow not the Lamb Chriſt, and ſuch though they have the name of Chriſtians, yet with the Light Chriſt they are found to be falſe Chriſtians, and to be of the many Antichriſts, who bares not the Image of Chriſt, and theſe are the accuſars of the Saints, whom the Lord hath Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whom he hath ſanctified he hath perfected, by the one offering, and who are they that dare lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect, but ſuch as <hi>Edward Laurance,</hi> in whoſe mouth the devil that accuſer of the Saints, is a lying ſpirit, whoſe mouth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now for theſe Scriptures, which is quoted by <hi>Edward Laurance</hi> and made uſe on by others, for this end before mentioned, I ſay that they who knew the Scriptures, as they knew them that gave them forth, do not produce them to this end; and whereas it is ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> cryed out of a body of ſin, and <hi>John</hi> ſaid, if we ſay we have no ſin, &amp;c. Tis true they ſaid ſo, and though <hi>Paul</hi> once witneſſed ſuch a condition, yet this proves not that <hi>Paul</hi> alwayes lived in ſin here, but that he was now in the time of putting it off, and of witneſſing the fulfilling of Chriſts words, who ſaid <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, all yee that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt,</hi> which if he had not come unto Chriſt, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

to him who condemned ſin, ſo come to ſee it overcome, and being ſet free from ſin brought forth fruit unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſed both theſe times, and before he could truly tell others, how fruit was brought forth unto Holineſs, or witneſſed it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was firſt in the time of crying out becauſe of ſin, but thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands now complain of ſin being in them, that are not yet come to the condition (it to witneſs) which <hi>Paul</hi> was in when he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out; <hi>John</hi> who alſo was a witneſs of the ſame things, he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto others, ſaid if we ſay we have no ſin we deceive our ſelves, &amp;c. But he did not ſay, if we ſay we ſhall be redeemed from ſin here, ſo that we ſhall not live in ſin here, we deceive our ſelves, &amp;c. No he did not ſay we cannot but live in ſin here, &amp;c. If we ſay otherwiſe, we deceive our ſelves, &amp;c. If you Prieſts could finde a Scripture that ſaith ſo, you would not hide it, but none of theſe ſay ſo, and <hi>John</hi> who was a witneſs of the ſame things with <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, if you abide in the Light as he is in the Light, then have you fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. For he was one who knew the true time of confeſſion of ſin, and the time of deliverance from it, ſo was a fit Miniſter to declare unto others of ſuch conditions.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Scriptures ſay, there is not a juſt man upon the Earth that doth good and ſinneth not, <hi>and there is none that doeth good no not one,</hi> &amp;c. This alſo is true in its place and time, for the beſt of mans performances, which is not the true Spirits work, is but as filthy clothing, which though they who live after the fleſh call the work good, and them that do it holy, yet with the Lord they are not numbred ſo, nor with his Saints; and the Apoſtle ſaid we know we are of God, &amp; all the World lies in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, but he did not ſay that all that are in this place, called the World, lies in wickedneſs, and <hi>John</hi> ſaw juſt men who lived not in ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were cleanſed from ſin by the Blood of Jeſus, and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw juſt men, who brought forth fruit unto holineſs, and <hi>David</hi> ſaid <hi>mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace;</hi> and there were many juſt men the Scripture makes mention of, ſome of which are before mentioned, which did good and cannot be charged with ſin, and in the ſame Chapter wherein, its ſaid, <hi>there is not a juſt man upon the Earth,</hi> doth the ſame man that ſpake thoſe words declare of a pure eſtate, ſeeing I finde more bitter then death, the woman whoſe heart is ſnares and

            <p>And you who ſay <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods own heart, and yet he was a ſinner, how is your wiſdom become fooliſhneſs and night come upon you for a viſion, well may it be ſaid of you, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid of thoſe Teachers in his time, that they were all blinde, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.10.

               <p>Pr. <hi>That I my ſelfe am a true Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, Proofe, Firſt by my call. Secondly by my Qualifications; my call I prove by the laying on of hands of the Presbyterie,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.14. Titus, 1.5 <hi>my Qualifications, by being fitted and qualified for that work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For this mans qualifications, they ſurely are very bad, who accuſeth the Saints, and hath denyed the end for which Chriſt was ſent, and doth the work of the devil as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is proved; and who called thee or any of your Prieſts to this work, but the prince of the ayre which ruling in your hearts, and leads you to do wickedly, and for theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they make nothing for any of you, but againſt you; and for the laying on of hands (there were women that had that) as is plain from the Scriptures, as <hi>Acts,</hi> 8.12.17. Will you grant they were made Miniſters by it, if not there is more reaſon for it then for yours, for by it they received the Holy Ghoſt, but I know none of you that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Holy Ghoſt by the hands that have been laid on you,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37369:6"/>
and <hi>Edward Lawrance</hi> thou knoweſt, that at the Diſpute thou wert proved a falſe Presbyter, and them that laid their hands on thee, as when thou waſt asked whether the Presbyters that laid their hands on thee took Tithes or no, to which thou anſweredſt they did, but could not prove the like of that Presbyter in the Apoſtles dayes; and to any who juſtly conſider the matter, it will plainly appear, Thats no juſt ground to own you for Miniſters of Chriſt, becauſe you have had the hands of a company of proud and covetous men laid on you, nor to own their action in ſo doing, no more then <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Inchanters work was to be owned or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with what <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of the Lord did; and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Truth and Scripture in this matter, and leave any rational man to ſearch the Scriptures in this point, and ſee what things was done by the laying on of hands then, and then conſider what yours doth, and it will plainly appear yours is but a mock to it, not worthy in the leaſt to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with it.</p>
               <p>And they who were really and truly Miniſters of Chriſt were called of God, fitted &amp; qualified by his ſpirit, and they followed Chriſt for their example, and their fruit made it manifeſt they were his Miniſters; Theſe had not ſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt, to tell people they could not but live in ſin here, and to take their Corn, Hay, Flax, Hemp, Wool, Lambs, Foals, Calves, yea Cows and Oxen from the people.

And <hi>Edward Lawrance,</hi> what fruit brought thou forth when thou took <hi>Richard Wards</hi> yoak of Oxen from him for Tithes, doth this prove thee a Miniſter of Chriſt or a wolf?

               <p>Now concerning his fourth and fifth Poſition, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all that he ſaid to either of them, except what is ſaid at the latter end of what is ſaid to the Reader, yet that they may not go without an anſwer, his two laſt Poſitions is as followeth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though theſe two Poſitions remain without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proof at all to uphold them, yet being I have found that they remain in the minds of ſome as if they were true; Take this anſwer, to the firſt of theſe, I anſwer, That for the people called Quakers, they are a People evil ſpoken of, in every Pariſh and Country I have been in ſince I firſt either heard of them or knew them, this I ſpeak as from what I know, and that not onely of one, two or three ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, but of all that I met with have I heard this evil ſpoke of, and I find in Scripture that the way that the true Church was of was evil ſpoken of every where, and I find that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> which was a true Church received <hi>Paul</hi> with fear and Trembling, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 7.15. and he ſpake to the <hi>Philippians</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:37369:7"/>
which was of the true Church to work out their ſalvation with fear and Trembling, and I know them to be a People that walks much in the fear of God, and who walks there have a place in God where the true Church is, as 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.1. and 2 <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 1. and where this man can find proofs to prove ſuch as theſe no true Church I know not, without he fly to lies and falſe reports for his refuge and proofs; but wo muſt come upon them that make lies their refuge, for with Truth he can never do it.</p>
               <p>And to the laſt Poſition I Anſwer, That the Quaking that is witneſſed amongſt theſe deſpiſed People, is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of the Devil, but the mighty power of God, which caſts down deluſions and overturns them, and I queſtion not but the ſame power was deſpiſed in the Prophets and Apoſtles dayes, by the ſame generation who then were ſtrangers to the power that wrought in the true Prophets and Apoſtles, ſo they were perſecuted as Deceivers, and put to death under the name of Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, and Deceivers, and <hi>Paul</hi> bid work out your Salvation with fear and trembling, as before is ſaid, and the true Church witneſſed Trembling, as before is proved, And the Lord ſaid to them that were got above the fear of God, whoſe hearts were hardened, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fear ye not me ſaith the Lord, will ye not Tremble at my preſence? <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 5.22. <hi>Iſaak</hi> Trembled, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.33. <hi>Habakuks</hi> belly Trembled, <hi>&amp;c.

But concerning this did <hi>Edward Lawrance</hi> make a jeſt, which ſhewed he was a ſtranger to the work of the power of God in him, and ſo where it is witneſſed he calls it a Deluſion of the Devil, This is one of them who puts good for evil, and calls evil good, but when your reward comes upon you it ſhall come as an armed man that you cannot eſcape it: ſo Repent betime leaſt there be no place left.</p>
